## Intro
* What is OpenRefine?
  OpenRefine is a free, open-source tool for cleaning data:
  * Correcting errors by hand is easy for small datasets, but:
    - more tedious for larger datasets
    - harder to find in larger datasets
    - reproducing corrections to other datasets is challenging!
* OpenRefine is NOT for:
  * very large datasets (e.g. > 1 million rows)
  * complicated calculations (e.g. numerical simulations involving tabular data)
  * non-tabular data; though it can handle other forms of untidy data: 
    - variables in rows
    - multiple values in a single row or column
    - values in multiple rows or columns)
* Learning Outcomes
  By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
  * load and examine data in OpenRefine
  * save and re-open OpenRefine projects
  * use clustering and transforms to correct data errors
  * export data cleaning steps as scripts

## Introduction to OpenRefine

* Basic Workflow
  * Download from https://openrefine.org/download.html
  * OpenRefine runs in your web browser:
    - starting the application should open a browser window
    - if not, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3333/ once the app is running
  * OpenRefine does *NOT* modify the original data
* Workflow steps
  * load your data or an existing project
  * do your data cleaning tasks
  * **OpenRefine does not modify your data files!**
  * Get work out by:
    - saving project
    - exporting data 
    - exporting data cleaning script
* Importing Data
  * OpenRefine can import most tabular data formats:
    - tab-separated values, comma-separated values, custom separators
    - excel spreadsheets (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
    - many others
  * check settings on import preview
* Import Preview

* Saving and Loading Projects

* DEMO
* Explore Distributions

* DEMO

## Basic Error Correction

* Categorical Variables
  * data values might have typos and/or other errors
  * How do you detect and fix these errors?
  --
    1. directly edit the labels in Facet mode
    2. use 'Cluster' options to group similar category labels
* DEMO
* Column Transformations
  * re-order / re-name columns
  * merge or split columns (by certain separators)

* Value Transformations
  * convert types
  * common edits (converting case, removing whitespace, etc.)
  * fill in empty cells if they represent repeated values from above
  * generic scripting language (General Refine Expression Language)
* DEMO

## Saving Data Cleaning Steps

* Reproducibility
  * OpenRefine records all data transformation steps
  * `Undo/Redo` allows you to select different stages of processing to revert to
  * `Extract` allows you to export the transformation steps in JSON format
  * `Apply` allows you to re-use a set of transformations from JSON format
* DEMO
* Summary
  OpenRefine has a lot of functionality:
  * simple interface for data cleaning
  * syntax for doing data transformations
  * reproducible processing workflows
  * lots of online examples and extensions
