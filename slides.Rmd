# What is OpenRefine?

OpenRefine is a free open-source tool to clean data in an **automatic** and **reproducible** way.

--

Finding/fixing errors is easy for small data, but:
* is tedious for larger datasets
* spotting inconsistencies is harder in larger datasets
* how do you apply the **same** corrections to new data?

---
# OpenRefine is NOT for:

* very large datasets (> 1 million rows)
* complicated calculations (e.g. performing numerical simulations)
* non-tabular data
  - there are some features to help with basic un"tidy"ness

---
# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
`r gsub("\n ", "\n", desc::desc_get("learningOutcomes"))`

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Introduction to OpenRefine

---
# Basic Workflow

* Download from https://openrefine.org/download.html
* OpenRefine runs in your web browser
  - starting the application should open a browser window
  - if not, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3333/ once the app is running

---
# Workflow

* import your data or load an existing project
* do your data cleaning  
**OpenRefine does not modify your data files!**
* Get work out by:
  - saving project
  - exporting data 
  - exporting data cleaning script

---
# Importing Data

* OpenRefine can import most tabular data formats:
  - tab-separated values, comma-separated values, custom separators
  - excel spreadsheets (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
  - many others

---
# Import Preview

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine' import screen, using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and showing both the tabular preview and the options for parsing the headers and delimiters."}
knitr::include_graphics("import_preview.png")
```

---
# Import Settings

* Check the preview to see if the data file is being parsed correctly!
  - adjust delimiters
  - number of lines to skip in the header
  - column names?
  - other common parsing

---
# Saving and Loading Projects

* OpenRefine has its own file format for saving and loading projects
  - do data cleaning across multiple sessions
  - no need to re-import data
  
---
# Projects Preview

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine', using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and exporting the OpenRefine project archive."}
knitr::include_graphics("export_project.png")
```

# DEMO

---
# Explore Data Distributions

* Use facets to examine how values are distributed in your data
  - facets apply to a single column
  - different types of data require different facets
  - visualization may reveal issues to be fixed (typos, outliers, etc.)

---
# Facet Preview

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine', using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and faceting the 'yr' column as text."}
knitr::include_graphics("text_facet.png")
```

# Basic Error Correction

---
# Categorical Variables

* data values might have typos and/or other errors
* How do you detect and fix these errors?
--

  - edit the labels directly in Facet mode
  - use 'Cluster' options to find groups of similar labels

---

# DEMO

---
# Clustering Methods

.small[* key collision
  + `fingerprint` - checks for basic string manipulation differences (spaces, accents, word order)
  + `n-gram fingerprint` - checks for clusters with the same set of n-grams (n-letter sequences)
  + remaining choices are phonetic (and for different languages)
* nearest neighbor
  + `levenshtein` - maximum distance between labels with sequences of at least `Block Chars` are identical
  + `ppm` - based on kolmogorov complexity of the strings]

---
# Column Transformations

* re-order / re-name columns
* merge or split columns (by certain separators)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine', using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and showing the 'Edit Column options' when selecting the 'scientificName' column."}
knitr::include_graphics("edit_column.png")
```

---
# Value Transformations

1. built-in transforms:
  * convert types (e.g. text to date)
  * basic edits (converting case, removing whitespace, etc.)
  * fill in empty cells if they represent repeated values from above

2. custom transforms:
  * programmable via [generic scripting language (General Refine Expression Language)](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/expressions/#grel-general-refine-expression-language)

# Saving Data Cleaning Steps

---
# Reproducibility

* OpenRefine records all data transformation steps
* `Undo/Redo` allows you to select different stages of processing to revert to
* `Extract` allows you to export the transformation steps in JSON format
* `Apply` allows you to re-use a set of transformations from JSON format

---

# DEMO

---
# Summary

OpenRefine has a lot of functionality:
* simple interface for data cleaning
* syntax for doing data transformations
* reproducible processing workflows
* lots of online examples and extensions
