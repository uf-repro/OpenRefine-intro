# What is OpenRefine?

OpenRefine is a free, open-source tool for cleaning data:
* Correcting errors by hand is easy for small datasets, but:
  - more tedious for larger datasets
  - harder to find in larger datasets
  - reproducing corrections to other datasets is challenging!

---
# OpenRefine is NOT for:

* very large datasets (e.g. > 1 million rows)
* complicated calculations (e.g. numerical simulations involving tabular data)
* non-tabular data; though it can handle other forms of untidy data: 
  - variables in rows
  - multiple values in a single row or column
  - values in multiple rows or columns)

---
# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
* load and examine data in OpenRefine
* save and re-open OpenRefine projects
* use clustering and transforms to correct data errors
* export data cleaning steps as scripts

# Introduction to OpenRefine

---
# Basic Workflow

* Download from https://openrefine.org/download.html
* OpenRefine runs in your web browser:
  - starting the application should open a browser window
  - if not, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3333/ once the app is running
* OpenRefine does *NOT* modify the original data

---
# Workflow steps

* load your data or an existing project
* do your data cleaning tasks
* **OpenRefine does not modify your data files!**
* Get work out by:
  - saving project
  - exporting data 
  - exporting data cleaning script

---
# Importing Data

* OpenRefine can import most tabular data formats:
  - tab-separated values, comma-separated values, custom separators
  - excel spreadsheets (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
  - many others
* check settings on import preview

---
# Import Preview

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine' import screen, using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and showing both the tabular preview and the options for parsing the headers and delimiters."}
knitr::include_graphics("import_preview.png")
```

---
# Saving and Loading Projects

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine', using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and exporting the OpenRefine project archive."}
knitr::include_graphics("export_project.png")
```

# DEMO

---
# Explore Distributions

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine', using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and faceting the 'yr' column as text."}
knitr::include_graphics("text_facet.png")
```

# Basic Error Correction

---
# Categorical Variables

* data values might have typos and/or other errors
* How do you detect and fix these errors?
--

  1. directly edit the labels in Facet mode
  2. use 'Cluster' options to group similar category labels

---

# DEMO

---
# Column Transformations

* re-order / re-name columns
* merge or split columns (by certain separators)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Screenshot of 'OpenRefine', using the sample data from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341, and showing the 'Edit Column options' when selecting the 'scientificName' column."}
knitr::include_graphics("edit_column.png")
```

---
# Value Transformations

* convert types
* common edits (converting case, removing whitespace, etc.)
* fill in empty cells if they represent repeated values from above
* generic scripting language (General Refine Expression Language)

# Saving Data Cleaning Steps

---
# Reproducibility

* OpenRefine records all data transformation steps
* `Undo/Redo` allows you to select different stages of processing to revert to
* `Extract` allows you to export the transformation steps in JSON format
* `Apply` allows you to re-use a set of transformations from JSON format

---

# DEMO

---
# Summary

OpenRefine has a lot of functionality:
* simple interface for data cleaning
* syntax for doing data transformations
* reproducible processing workflows
* lots of online examples and extensions
